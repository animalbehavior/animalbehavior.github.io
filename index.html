                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Ethology</strong> is the analysis and study of animal <strong>behavior</strong>, which in turn is the concept of what an animal does and how well it does it.</p>
                    <p>Behavior:
                        <ul>
                            <li>is affected by both genes and the environment</li>
                            <li>is essential for survival and reproduction</li>
                            <li>is subject to natural selection over time</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Causes</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Causes</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Behaviors have two different causes.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>proximate</strong> cause of a behavior is based on <em>how</em> an animal behaves and is restricted to the immediate cause(s) of a behavioral action.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>ultimate</strong> cause of a behavior is based on <em>why</em> an animal behaves as it does and is focused on the evolutionary changes in behavioral actions.</p>

                <div class="item">Types</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Types</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Animals exhibit both <strong>innate</strong> and <strong>learned</strong> behaviors. Innate behaviors include foraging, sexual, and social behavior. Animals also exhibit a variety of ways through which they may modify existing behavior based on specific experiences through learning. These types of behaviors will be further explained in the following sections.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Innate Behavior</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Innate Behavior</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Innate</strong> behaviors are inherited; they are unlearned. These behaviors ensure that activities essential to survival are performed correctly without prior practice.</p>
                    <p>A species may exhibit <strong>environmental indifference</strong> in its innate behaviors, which signifies that those behaviors and actions are performed in the same manner by every member of the species. Similarly, <strong>fixed action patterns</strong> are instinctive behaviors that are similar throughout a species and inevitably run to completion. The latter is triggered by a <strong>sign stimulus</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Examples of innate behaviors are directed movements such as <strong>kinesis</strong>&mdash;a simple change in activity or turning rate in response to a stimulus&mdash;and <strong>taxis</strong>&mdash;automatic and oriented movement triggered by stimuli. Common examples of the latter are phototaxis, chemotaxis, and geotaxis.</p>
                    <p>Another innate behavior is <strong>migration</strong>, which is an animal's regular, long-distance change in location led by environmental cues such as the Sun, other stars, Earth's magnetic field, and landmarks.</p>
                    <p>To faciliate their behaviors, animals use certain communications and signalling. This includes the use of <strong>pheromones</strong>&mdash;chemicals emitted by members of one species that affect other members of the species&mdash;and visual, tactile, and auditory signals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Habituation</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Habituation</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Habituation</strong> is a learned behavior characterized by the loss of responsiveness to stimuli that convey little or no information. It is one of the simpler forms of learning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Imprinting</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Imprinting</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Imprinting</strong> is a combination of learning with certain innate components. Animals are often only subject to imprinting during a <strong>sensitive period</strong> early in their lives, and the result is a generally irreversible behavior change.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Spatial Learning</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Spatial Learning</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Spatial learning</strong> allows animals to develop a sense of their surroundings through a <strong>cognitive map</strong>, which is an internal representation of spatial relationships among objects in an animal's surroundings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Associative Learning</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Associative Learning</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Associative learning</strong> is the association of a stimulus with something else. Examples include <strong>classical conditioning</strong>, where a particular outcome occurs in the presence of the stimulus, such as salivating in response to a bell, or <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, where a behavior is associated with reward or punishment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Cognition</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Cognition</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Cognition</strong> is the use of the nervous system to take information from sensory receptors and process it to solve a new problem.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Social Learning</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Social Learning</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Social learning</strong> is learning done through observing and replicating the acts of other members of an animal's social group doing the same task.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Foraging</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Foraging</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Foraging</strong> is the act of searching for, capturing, and consuming food. Evolution favors organisms which minimize the energy used to catch and consume their food and maximize energy gained from their food, because this leaves the organism with the maximum remaining energy to perform other functions. As a result of this, <strong>cost-benefit analysis</strong> may be used when studying foraging.</p>
<p>As an example, crows which drop their food to break their outer layers must balance the energy used to fly up and drop the food with the energy gained from finally consuming the food.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Sexual Behavior</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Sexual Behavior</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>A fundamental component of evolution is <strong>sexual selection</strong>, by which animals seek, attract, choose, and compete for mates. The following table describes characteristics of different sexual relationships:
