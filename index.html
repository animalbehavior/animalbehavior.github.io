                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Ethology</strong> is the analysis and study of animal <strong>behavior</strong>, which in turn is the concept of what an animal does and how well it does it.</p>
                    <p>Behavior:
                        <ul>
                            <li>is affected by both genes and the environment</li>
                            <li>is essential for survival and reproduction</li>
                            <li>is subject to natural selection over time</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Causes</div>

                    <h2>Causes</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Behaviors have two different causes.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>proximate</strong> cause of a behavior is based on <em>how</em> an animal behaves and is restricted to the immediate cause(s) of a behavioral action.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>ultimate</strong> cause of a behavior is based on <em>why</em> an animal behaves as it does and is focused on the evolutionary changes in behavioral actions.</p>

                <div class="item">Types</div>

                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Types</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Animals exhibit both <strong>innate</strong> and <strong>learned</strong> behaviors. Innate behaviors include foraging, sexual, and social behavior. Animals also exhibit a variety of ways through which they may modify existing behavior based on specific experiences through learning. These types of behaviors will be further explained in the following sections.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Innate Behavior</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Innate Behavior</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Innate</strong> behaviors are inherited; they are unlearned. These behaviors ensure that activities essential to survival are performed correctly without prior practice.</p>
                    <p>A species may exhibit <strong>environmental indifference</strong> in its innate behaviors, which signifies that those behaviors and actions are performed in the same manner by every member of the species. Similarly, <strong>fixed action patterns</strong> are instinctive behaviors that are similar throughout a species and inevitably run to completion. The latter is triggered by a <strong>sign stimulus</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Examples of innate behaviors are directed movements such as <strong>kinesis</strong>&mdash;a simple change in activity or turning rate in response to a stimulus&mdash;and <strong>taxis</strong>&mdash;automatic and oriented movement triggered by stimuli. Common examples of the latter are phototaxis, chemotaxis, and geotaxis.</p>
                    <p>Another innate behavior is <strong>migration</strong>, which is an animal's regular, long-distance change in location led by environmental cues such as the Sun, other stars, Earth's magnetic field, and landmarks.</p>
                    <p>To faciliate their behaviors, animals use certain communications and signalling. This includes the use of <strong>pheromones</strong>&mdash;chemicals emitted by members of one species that affect other members of the species&mdash;and visual, tactile, and auditory signals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Habituation</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Habituation</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Habituation</strong> is a learned behavior characterized by the loss of responsiveness to stimuli that convey little or no information. It is one of the simpler forms of learning.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Imprinting</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Imprinting</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Imprinting</strong> is a combination of learning with certain innate components. Animals are often only subject to imprinting during a <strong>sensitive period</strong> early in their lives, and the result is a generally irreversible behavior change.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">Spatial Learning</div>
                <div class="info">
                    <span class="back">&#129190;</span>
                    <h2>Spatial Learning</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>Spatial learning</strong> allows animals to develop a sense of their surroundings through a <strong>cognitive map</strong>, which is an internal representation of spatial relationships among objects in an animal's surroundings.</p>
